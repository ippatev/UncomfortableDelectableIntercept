  <p>Code of Practice:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Wear the uniform </li>
    <li>Think long term (like 30 years from now)</li>
    <li>Build stories and languages, not things </li>
    <li>Create your own universe (or join ours) </li>
    <li>Collect samples </li>
    <li>Be a sample for somebody else </li>
    <li>Look for loyalty, not for a skill set </li>
    <li>Do not build utilitarian products. However, use them as a medium to express yourself </li>
    <li>Do not exploit introverts — doesn't work long term. Learn to be an introvert yourself </li>
    <li>Travel more </li>
    <li>Do not work for corporations. Old corporations were meaningful when their founders were alive, but now, they
      have outlived their relevancy. They exist only to keep their numbers growing </li>
    <li>New corporations are no better. They have scaled up features, and today’s founders want hyper-growth for
      growth’s sake (it seems like every line of&nbsp;code, every feature deserves its own corporation — it sure
      doesn't) </li>
    <li>So, fuck the corporations</li>
    <li>Tell the truth (bullshit never works long term) </li>
    <li>Study and research fashion</li>
    <li>Your phone is a temporary feature — don’t spend your life on it (like you wouldn’t spend it on a fax machine)
    </li>
    <li>Fuck likes, followers, fake lives, fake friends</li>
    <li>Remake your environment. Build it for yourself, and people will come </li>
    <li>Only trust those who make things you love</li>
    <li>Move to LA </li>
    <li>Don’t buy property</li>
    <li>Don’t go to Mars (just yet)</li>
    <li>Use only one font, just a few colors, and just a few shapes </li>
    <li>Use spreadsheets, but only to map out 30 cells — one for each year of the rest of your life</li>
    <li>The next three are the most important</li>
    <li>The past doesn’t exist — don’t get stuck in it</li>
    <li>Don’t go to Silicon Valley (it’s not for you if you’re still reading this) </li>
    <li>Remind yourself daily: you and everyone you know will die</li>
    <li>We must build the most beautiful things</li>
    <li>We are 2046 kids</li>
  </ol>
